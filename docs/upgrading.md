# Upgrading from upstream

## Branches and remotes

`main` carries the fork. `master` and the other upstream branches mirror gitlab.com/cznic/quickjs and get no commits of their own.

Set up the remotes once in a fresh clone. The engine remotes must not fetch tags, because libquickjs tags (v0.13.1, ...) would clash with the tags of this repository:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://gitlab.com/cznic/quickjs.git
git remote add upstream-lib https://gitlab.com/cznic/libquickjs.git
git config remote.upstream-lib.tagOpt --no-tags
git fetch upstream
git fetch upstream-lib 'refs/tags/*:refs/tags/lib/*'   # engine tags as lib/v0.13.2, ...
```

Do the upgrade on a branch (`git switch -c upgrade-libquickjs-<tag>`) and merge it into `main` as [commit.md](commit.md#branches-and-merges) says.

## Taking a new engine release

`lib/` was added with `git subtree`, so an upstream libquickjs release merges in with its history:

```sh
git subtree pull --prefix lib upstream-lib <libquickjs tag, e.g. v0.13.2>
```

### Conflicts to expect

`lib/ccgo_*.go`: every upstream release regenerates these files, so the two lines added to `XJS_ToCStringLen2`, the calls into `lib/backtrace.go` (lazy error stacks), the `getTimezoneOffset` that answers 0 (local time is UTC) and the calls into `lib/uncatchable.go` (uncatchable exceptions) and `lib/outofmemory.go` (out of memory), the compiler's out of memory checks, the stack limit of a new runtime, the call paths without `alloca`, the functions without a TLS frame, the changes to the interpreter loop, the call into `lib/objlit.go`, the call into `lib/regexskip.go`, the cold paths moved out, the TLS frames taken per statement, `set_value` written out in the interpreter, the interrupt countdown, the front cache, the shape cache, the call into `lib/forin.go`, the calls into `lib/bitwise.go`, the comparisons written out in the interpreter, the call into `lib/atomkey.go`, the calls into `lib/fieldchain.go`, the calls into `lib/jsonstr.go`, the calls into `lib/stringsearch.go`, the calls into `lib/funcshape.go`, the calls into `lib/regexcache.go`, the calls into `lib/regexpoll.go` and `lib/charge.go`, the tests of the classes of regexps with the v flag, the clock functions that call `lib/clock.go`, the frame of `JS_CallInternal` taken once on linux, the frames freed without a defer, the part of `quickjs-libc.c` that goes, the likely and unlikely tests written as `expect64` and the TLS frames taken without a call on linux conflict. Take the upstream version of every generated file, then put the changes back:

```sh
git checkout --theirs -- 'lib/ccgo_*.go' 'lib/internal/run-test262/ccgo_*.go'
go run ./internal/fixlib
```

`fixlib` also rewrites `modernc.org/libquickjs` imports in hand-written files under `lib/`. `go run ./internal/fixlib -check` lists files that still need changes.

### The order of the reports

Some steps check the code against a list kept in `internal/fixlib`, and a flag prints the list as the files have it. A report fails while a list it depends on is out of date, so update them in this order: `-frames`, then `-up` and `-qjslibc` (both on the files as taken from upstream), then `-cells`, then `-slots`. Then fix `lazySites` (`internal/fixlib/lazy.go`) and `inlineCallees` (`internal/fixlib/inline.go`) by hand from the numbers `fixlib` reports: no flag prints them. Last come the fingerprints, `-define`, `-backtrace`, `-regex`, `-lazyaddr`, `-inline`, `-poll`, `-runtime`, `-front`, `-shape`, `-forin`, `-bitwise`, `-eq`, `-atomkey`, `-fieldchain`, `-oneframe`, `-json`, `-search`, `-funcshape`, `-recache`, `-repoll`, `-classescape`, `-charge` and `-clock`. Each of these runs every change of `fixlib` and skips only the fingerprint checks, so a report that stops on another list, such as "TLS frames taken by statement changed", means that list is out of date, not the one the flag prints. Read every new line before you put it in.

The final changes have separate printers. `-expect` reads either raw upstream or already generated files and runs the earlier changes in memory through `dropDefers`, including the trim of `quickjs-libc.c`. It then counts the likely and unlikely tests before applying the final changes, without checking `expectSites` or writing any file. All checks of the earlier changes still apply, so update their lists first. `-fastframes` prints the fingerprint of the TLS structs and methods in the libc release of `go.mod`. `-ephemeron` prints the collector fingerprints after the earlier final rewrites, without applying its own hooks, `-young` the fingerprints of `youngSites` after them, with `fixEphemeron` applied, `-shareddebug` the fingerprints of `sharedDebugSites` after the final changes before it, and `-asynccontext` the fingerprints of `asyncContextSites` after every other final change. Read every new or removed site before updating these lists.

### When fixlib stops

`fixlib` fails when a generated file no longer has the shape a change expects, which means upstream changed the code the change touches and it needs a fresh look. The doc of each change says, under "When upstream changes it", what to read and what to update. Do not edit the generated code by hand: teach `fixlib` the new form instead.

fixlib takes a change of its own as made only when its whole text is where it puts it. If it reports that such a text is somewhere else, is there twice, or that `_resolve_labels` has a label `out_of_memory` or part of the change, upstream has likely written part of the change itself: read the new code, then drop that part of fixlib or teach it the new place.

### After fixlib passes

1. `go run ./internal/fixlib -check` reports nothing, and running `go run ./internal/fixlib` again changes nothing.
2. Run the checks of [testing.md](testing.md#before-committing), the [focused checks](testing.md#focused-checks) and [test262](testing.md#test262): the 58 known errors must stay the same, line for line, unless the new release fixed some, in which case update `lib/test262_errors.txt`.
3. Build every target (`make build_all_targets`).
4. Check that `fixlib` makes the committed files from the new upstream files, byte for byte ([Same as upstream after fixlib](testing.md#same-as-upstream-after-fixlib)), with the new release in place of v0.13.1.
5. Release it (see [releasing.md](releasing.md)) and measure it in tifa (see [performance.md](performance.md#measuring-in-tifa)).

## The C patch

`lib/internal/patch/quickjs.diff` holds the same changes in C, so that a regeneration keeps them. Keep these hunks:

- the `DIRECT_DISPATCH` condition: disable computed goto for `__CCGO__` and `__EMSCRIPTEN__`, and keep upstream's computed goto for native C builds. This condition does not change the generated Go or need a `fixlib` rewrite
- the ephemeron collector, symbol marking, runtime scratch pointer and conditional map marking hunks
- the young collection hunks: `young_obj_list`, `young_dead_list` and `young_sweep` in `JSRuntime`, `add_gc_object`, `young_splice` in `JS_RunGCInternal`, `JS_ComputeMemoryUsage` and `JS_DumpMemoryUsage`, `young_defer` in `__JS_FreeValueRT` and `async_func_free`, and `JS_RunYoungGC` with its declaration in `quickjs.h`
- the shared debug hunks: `JS_READ_OBJ_SHARED_DEBUG` in `quickjs.h`, `shared_debug` in `JSFunctionBytecode` and `BCReaderState`, `bc_get_debug_buf` and its two calls in `JS_ReadFunctionTag`, `JS_ReadObject`, `free_function_bytecode` and `compute_bytecode_size`
- the `JS_ToCStringLen2` hunk, unless upstream QuickJS has fixed the bug
- the `getTimezoneOffset` hunk
- the lazy stack hunks: `JSBacktrace`, the built-in `JS_CLASS_BACKTRACE` class, `js_backtrace_build` and the `js_backtrace_*` calls in `JS_GetPropertyInternal`, `JS_GetOwnPropertyInternal`, `JS_DefineProperty`, the interpreter's `GET_FIELD_INLINE`, `get_prop_string`, `js_print_error`, `js_print_object`, `JS_ComputeMemoryUsage`, the callers that only need the attributes of a property (`js_get_own_property_flags`)
- the uncatchable exception hunks: `js_uncatchable_pending`, `js_get_exception` and its callers, `JS_IsUncatchableException`, and the checks in `JS_Throw`, `JS_CallInternal` and `JS_IteratorClose`
- the out of memory hunks: `JS_ThrowOutOfMemory`, `JS_ThrowError2`, the regexp callers of `JS_ThrowOutOfMemory`
- the compiler hunks: `dbuf_claim` in `cutils.c`, `push_scope`, `pop_scope`, `js_create_function`, `resolve_variables`, `resolve_labels`, the two code moves of the parser, `js_parse_error_v`, `next_token`, the two patches in `js_parse_class`, the test removal in `js_parse_destructuring_element`, `JS_WriteObjectAtoms`, `JS_WriteObject2` and the error label of `lre_compile` in `libregexp.c`
- the stack hunks: the stack size `JS_NewRuntime2` sets, and `JS_ThrowStackOverflow`
- the regexp class hunks: the escapes of a ClassSetReservedPunctuator and the two tests that check only in a class (upstream's commit a479eff) in `get_class_atom`, and the call in `parse_class_string_disjunction`. Drop the two tests once upstream has them
- the interrupt hunks: `lre_poll_interrupts` in `libregexp.h`, `quickjs.c` and `fuzz/fuzz_regexp.c`, `re_poll_interrupts` and its calls in `libregexp.c`, the interrupt branch of `js_compile_regexp`, and `js_charge_interrupts` with its calls in `string_buffer_init2`, `string_buffer_realloc` and `js_parse_init`

After a regeneration that includes them, `lib/backtrace.go`, `lib/uncatchable.go`, `lib/outofmemory.go`, `lib/regexpoll.go`, `lib/charge.go`, `fixClassEscapes` and their wiring in `fixlib` are no longer needed (the count in `lib/regexcache.go` then calls the generated `_js_charge_interrupts`).

The calls without `alloca`, the functions without a TLS frame, the changes to the interpreter loop, the calls into `lib/objlit.go` and `lib/regexskip.go`, the cold paths moved out, the frames taken by statement, the calls written out in the interpreter, the interrupt countdown, the front cache, the shape cache, the calls into `lib/forin.go`, `lib/bitwise.go`, `lib/atomkey.go`, `lib/fieldchain.go`, `lib/jsonstr.go`, `lib/stringsearch.go` and `lib/funcshape.go`, the comparisons written out in the interpreter, the frame of `JS_CallInternal` taken once, the frames freed without a defer and the part of `quickjs-libc.c` that goes have no C form: they are changes to what ccgo generates, so `fixlib` applies them after every regeneration.

## Other files of an engine release

- `lib/go.mod`, `lib/go.sum`: they do not exist here. When upstream changed them, delete them again (`git rm lib/go.mod lib/go.sum`) and bring any newer requirement into the root `go.mod`.
- `lib/internal/run-test262/go.mod` is ours. Upstream has none there.
- `lib/internal/run-test262/ccgo_*.go`: ccgo links a whole copy of the engine into the test262 runner, so as generated the runner tests that copy and not `lib/`. `fixlib` turns each engine API function of the runner into a call of the same function in `lib/` (`lib/test262_runner.go` exports the one ccgo leaves unexported). Take the upstream files and run `fixlib`, as for `lib/ccgo_*.go`.

This fork does not regenerate `lib/ccgo_*.go` itself. `lib/generator.go` still assumes it is the root of its own module.

## Moving to a newer Go

The Go assembly of the C engine (`internal/cengine`, checked in) was made and checked with Go 1.27.2, on linux/amd64 and darwin/arm64. `go.mod` asks for 1.27.0 or later and nothing stops a build with a newer Go, so a user on a newer Go runs assembly that was never checked against it. The checks of the generator and its tests depend on these things of Go 1.27.2:

- The stack check at the start of every function that is not NOSPLIT: a compare of the stack pointer with the guard in the goroutine, `g.stackguard0` (offset 16 of `g`, with `g` in R14 on amd64 and X28 on arm64), a branch to a call of `runtime.morestack_noctxt.abi0`, and a jump back to the start (`internal/goasm/gen/verify_insn.go`, `arm64_verify.go`).
- The room of a chain of NOSPLIT functions: the linker gives 800 bytes, and the generator keeps 64 of them free below the deepest frame for the call of `runtime.sigpanic` that a fault adds and its call of morestack (`internal/goasm/gen/nosplit.go`). The 64 bytes come from the source of Go 1.27.2.
- The preemption hammer (`internal/cengine/hammer_test.go`) reads `g` and writes its stack guard.

When Go changes any of these, a check of the generator or a test fails. A program built with the new Go is not checked when it is built. So, before you move to a newer Go:

1. Run `go test -p 1 -tags slowjs_cengine,testhooks ./internal/cengine .`, and the hammer (`CENGINE_HAMMER_N=3000 go test -tags slowjs_cengine,cenginehammer -run Hammer ./internal/cengine`). The fault tests (`TestFault*`, `TestFaultNoSplit`) are the ones that see a changed signal path.
2. Run the generator's tests with the new Go (`make check-fast`, its `goasm` step). They build sample programs, link them, and check the stack check, the call of `runtime.morestack_noctxt.abi0` and the NOSPLIT room in the linked binary, so a changed shape fails there. Then check the engine itself the same way, with the post-link check of [testing.md](testing.md#the-go-host-of-the-generated-engine) (`-verify-bin`, on a test binary built with `-tags slowjs_cengine,goasmkeep`). `make check-gen` does not test the Go version: it only checks that the files checked in are what the generator makes.
3. Read the source of `runtime.sigpanic` and the stack check of the new release if the fault tests fail, and update `FaultRoom` only for what you read there.
4. When all pass, write the new version here and in the README, in both languages.

## Taking a new release of the Go API

```sh
git merge <upstream tag>
```

Upstream commits import `modernc.org/libquickjs` and `modernc.org/quickjs`. After the merge, drop `modernc.org/libquickjs` from `go.mod`, run `grep -rn 'modernc.org/quickjs\|modernc.org/libquickjs' --include='*.go' .` and switch what it finds to `github.com/liustack/slowjs`. The only expected leftover is the Symbol key `"modernc.org/quickjs/intl"` in `intl/stub.js`, which is a runtime marker, not an import path.

`intl/` has been rewritten here, so an upstream change to it conflicts. Keep this fork's version and bring over only what the upstream change fixes, checked with the golden test below.

## Upgrading modernc.org/libc

The VM puts libc's TLS stack back after a panic (`tlsstack_linux.go`, `tlsstack_other.go`) and keeps a block of it outside linux (`warmTLS`), and both know how libc keeps that stack: one block per slot on linux, bytes in segments elsewhere. After a libc release:

- Run `go test -run EnginePanic .` with and without `-tags=libc.memgrind`, and `go test -run TLSWarm .` outside linux.
- `lib/fastframes_linux.go` takes and frees TLS frames on linux as `TLS.Alloc` and `TLS.Free` do, on fields of `libc.TLS` it finds by name. `go run ./internal/fixlib` stops when their text changed: read it as [calls-and-tls-frames.md](fork-changes/calls-and-tls-frames.md#tls-frames-taken-without-a-call-on-linux) says, then `go run ./internal/fixlib -fastframes`, and run `go test -run FastFrame ./lib` on linux.
- Bring the new version into `go.mod`, and run `go mod tidy` in `lib/internal/run-test262` and `compare/` as well.
- In tifa, collect the engine profile again and check that several VMs still scale (`BenchmarkShopParallel`), as tifa's docs/testing.md says: libc's allocator lock is what held several VMs back before v0.26.12.

## Updating the intl locale data

All Intl constructors use the go-intl packs below. `intl/cldr.bin`, its generator and the host-zone DST table have been removed. Builds and tests need no network or browser.

The pack generator reads `intl/testdata/chromium/icu.json.gz`. It records ICU resource inheritance, raw calendar and zone strings, non-Latin number symbols and the RBNF bundles Chromium ships. The generator applies those choices to go-intl's models and encodes one shared pool for each data set. Missing RBNF data follows ICU's style-construction failure path. It does not substitute an invented value.

To update the reference browser, use a cached Chromium executable and Playwright installation. Set `CHROMIUM` and `PLAYWRIGHT` for the commands below:

```sh
node intl/testdata/chromium/record.cjs icudtl
go run -p 2 -tags gointl_walk ./internal/gointl/internal/qjspack/gen -icudtl /path/to/icudtl.dat
internal/gointl/qjs-sync.sh chromium
internal/gointl/qjs-sync.sh pack
node intl/testdata/chromium/record.cjs golden
node intl/testdata/chromium/record.cjs probes migration
go test -short -p 2 ./intl/... ./temporal/...
```

Record each other golden set with `record.cjs golden <set>`, as the recorder's header lists. Chromium 156.0.8078.4 uses ICU commit `5aa526207171ecadf31597f0980a7b7ad8872f33`. The pack tool now owns the ICU parser formerly in `intl/internal/gen`.

Keep the raw browser answers. Explain every changed expression before updating expectations. The three Winnipeg cases in `TestGoIntlMigration` name exact tz 2026e answers because the reference browser has older zones.

## Updating go-intl (`internal/gointl`)

`internal/gointl` is a copy of [go-intl](https://github.com/go-quickjs/go-intl), a pure Go ECMA-402 and Temporal library, at the release and commit in `internal/gointl/UPSTREAM` (v0.6.1). Package `intl` uses it for every constructor, Date and Temporal formatting, and date ranges. Package `temporal` computes with its temporal package and reads its zones and calendars. It is internal because its API is go-intl's and changes between releases, and it sits at the module root so that `intl/` and `temporal/` can import it.

The files and directories named `qjs*`, and `UPSTREAM`, are ours. `qjs_temporalformat.go` keeps unchanged Temporal patterns as Chromium 156 does, exposes the actual date pattern for registry keys and honors an offset supplied by Temporal. Rerun the focused formatting corpora after updating it. Everything else is go-intl's, with its import path rewritten, and is changed only by `internal/gointl/qjs.patch`, which covers data loading, Chromium style construction and notices: `source.go` serves our packs instead of go-intl's 18.9 MB `data.pack`, `internal/blob` tells the pack tool which pool parts a locale reads, `dictbe.go` takes a missing break dictionary for none, the loaders of the data in the readers' packs below call the function that links their pack, and `temporal/solar.go` and `temporal/zoneinfo.go` start with a header saying that parts are ported from calendrical_calculations and changed, which its Apache-2.0 license asks of a changed file. A file of a new go-intl release that ports from an Apache-2.0 project gets the same header through `qjs.patch`.

The data is in `internal/gointl/qjsdata/`, written by `internal/gointl/internal/qjspack/gen` from go-intl's `data/` directory:

- `core.bin` (3.39 MB), everything but those below.
- `names.bin` (1.9 MB), the display names. Build with `-tags slowjs_intl_nonames` to leave it out: `Intl.DisplayNames` then has no names, and `of` answers every code with its fallback, the code or `undefined` with `fallback: 'none'`.
- `cjdict.bin` (2.0 MB), the Chinese and Japanese word dictionary. Build with `-tags slowjs_intl_nocjdict` to leave it out: a run of Chinese or Japanese is then one word, as in an ICU without the dictionary.
- `tz.bin` (92 KB), what package `temporal` reads: ICU's time zones, the zone names Temporal takes, the tables of the Chinese, Korean and Umm al-Qura calendars, and `tzversion.bin`, the tz release of the zones. `Embedded` serves it with the rest, and `EmbeddedTemporalSource` serves it alone. The two share one copy: a chunk read through either is inflated once.
- The readers' packs, each linked only into a binary that links a function reading it (`qjs_readers.go`): `dates.bin` (677 KB), what go-intl's `DateTimeFormat` reads, `zonenames.bin` (1.27 MB), the zone names, and `hostzones.bin` (6 KB), the tables of the guess at the host's zone. Package `intl` uses these packs for Date and Temporal values and ranges. It links the date and zone-name packs, but not the host-zone pack (`TestLinksOnlyReadData`). Each loader of their data calls `qjsUseDates`, `qjsUseZoneNames` or `qjsUseHostZones` first, through `qjs.patch`, and `TestQJSReadersUsePacks` fails when a function of a new go-intl release reads one of their data sets without that call: add it to the patch. A data set a new release adds for a new reader gets a pack of its own the same way, in `packOf` of the pack tool, a variable in `qjs_readers.go` and the calls in its loaders.

The locales are those of Chromium 156. `qjsdata/chromium.json` records which locale Chromium resolves each of go-intl's available locales to, for every `Intl` constructor, and each service here has the locales Chromium resolves to themselves: `TestQJSResolveMatchesChromium` checks that every service resolves every one of those tags as Chromium does. A language's data is kept when Chromium has the bare language for a service, with the languages it inherits from, and its plural rules when Chromium has it for `PluralRules`. Chromium has some locales whose language it has no data for, such as `ha-GH` without `ha`: they format with the root's data there, and here. The pack tool prints the languages it drops and those it keeps the plural rules of only.

`qjsnumbers.bin` marks number resources that the pack generator has already resolved. Raw go-intl data has no marker and keeps its original ICU alias lookup. Unknown marker versions fail when read.

The shared pools of strings, the collation root and the break dictionaries are kept uncompressed, because a formatter reads only a little of each and the pages of the binary it does not touch stay on disk. The rest is DEFLATE in chunks, and a chunk is inflated into the heap, once per process, the first time a formatter reads a file in it. `QJSInflated` reports how much that is.

The bytes a formatter reads are never to be written: an uncompressed chunk is the binary's read-only data, where a write faults, and an inflated one is shared by every formatter and VM in the process. Code that hands such bytes to JS, as an `ArrayBuffer` or the like, copies them first.

`make gointl` runs the checks `go test ./...` does not: the pack tool's tests, which need the `gointl_walk` build tag, the build without the optional packs, and that `qjsdata/` is what go-intl's data gives with the time zones below.

### Time zones

go-intl v0.6.1 makes its zones from tz 2026c. The packs carry those of a later update, the one `internal/gointl/qjstz` names (2026e now), so that a zone that changed its rules since gives what browsers on the newer data give. `qjs-sync.sh checkout` downloads ICU's update for that release from the icu-data repository (`tzdata/icunew/<version>/44`: `zoneinfo64.txt`, `timezoneTypes.txt`, `windowsZones.txt`, `metaZones.txt`) and ICU's sources, checks their sha256 against `qjstz`, and runs go-intl's own `tzgen` on them in a copy of the checkout, `$GOINTL_UPSTREAM-tz<version>`. Only `data/tz/`, `data/windowszones.bin` and `data/abbreviationzones.bin` change, and the copy gets `data/tzversion.bin`, which goes into `tz.bin`. `pack` reads that copy's `data/`. `test` makes its packs of go-intl's data as it is, zones included, since go-intl's corpora hold Node's answers at go-intl's tz release. `test-chromium` runs the fork's tests against the shipped packs and recorded browser answers. Between 2026c and 2026e those tests differ in Bogota (1992), Tehran (1979), Dublin (1925), Inuvik, Winnipeg and Rainy_River, and EST5EDT, CST6CDT, MST7MDT and PST8PDT, which 2026d made zones of their own: all changes the tz NEWS file lists. Zone names and metazones use go-intl's models with Chromium's resource choices. `TestQJSTZVersion` checks the release `tz.bin` holds.

To move to a newer update, once ICU has published it:

1. Set `TZ_VERSION` in `qjstz`, and the four checksums, from `sha256sum` of the four files under `tzdata/icunew/<version>/44`.
2. Run `qjs-sync.sh checkout`, then `qjs-sync.sh pack`.
3. Change the version in `TestQJSTZVersion`, in [temporal.md](fork-changes/temporal.md#zone-data) and in the package doc of `temporal`, and add a case to `TestZoneData` in `temporal/all_test.go` for a zone the update changed.
4. Run `qjs-sync.sh test -p 2`, `qjs-sync.sh test-chromium -p 2`, `go test ./internal/gointl/... ./temporal` and `make gointl`.

When go-intl itself moves to that update or a later one, `checkout` still writes the zones of `qjstz`. Set `qjstz` to go-intl's release then, or later, never earlier.

To move to a new go-intl release, set `VERSION` and `COMMIT` in `internal/gointl/UPSTREAM`, then:

```sh
internal/gointl/qjs-sync.sh checkout       # clones go-intl into $GOINTL_UPSTREAM (default ~/.cache/quickjs-gointl/go-intl)
internal/gointl/qjs-sync.sh update         # copies its runtime sources here and applies qjs.patch
internal/gointl/qjs-sync.sh chromium       # records what Chromium resolves the new tags to
internal/gointl/qjs-sync.sh pack           # writes qjsdata/ again
internal/gointl/qjs-sync.sh test -p 2      # go-intl's own tests, on packs of every language
internal/gointl/qjs-sync.sh test-chromium -p 2  # the fork's Chromium corpora on the shipped packs
go test ./internal/gointl/... && make gointl
```

`qjsdata/NOTICE-ICU` holds ICU's notices for the ICU data and word break dictionaries in the packs: lines 1 to 401 of ICU's `LICENSE` at the tag `release-78.3`, after a short note of ours. `update` copies go-intl's `LICENSE` but not this file. When go-intl takes its data from a new ICU release (its `SOURCES.md` names it), write the file again from ICU's `LICENSE` at that release's tag, with `gh api 'repos/unicode-org/icu/contents/LICENSE?ref=release-<version>'`: the same sections, unchanged, with the version and line numbers in the note updated, and add the notice of any dictionary or data the packs take that was not there before. The other `qjsdata/NOTICE-*` files hold the notices of what go-intl ported from V8 (`NOTICE-V8`) and from Temporal's crates (`NOTICE-TEMPORAL` for boa-dev's, `NOTICE-ICU4X` for ICU4X's), at the versions in its `SOURCES.md`. When a release of go-intl moves one of those versions, or ports from a project not listed there, copy that project's license, and its `NOTICE` file if it has one, at the new version (a crate's from `https://static.crates.io/crates/<name>/<name>-<version>.crate`, V8's from `deps/v8/LICENSE` of the Node release), update the note at the top and the tables in [NOTICE.md](../NOTICE.md#code-and-data-that-go-intl-took-from-other-projects).

`chromium` needs Node and the Chromium that Playwright drives, set up as for the intl golden test in [Updating the intl locale data](#updating-the-intl-locale-data) (`PLAYWRIGHT`, and `CHROMIUM` for another browser). Run it again for a newer Chromium too. Where `qjs.patch` no longer applies, make the change by hand and run `qjs-sync.sh patch` to write the patch again. When `pack` fails with parts of a pool that no locale reaches, a data package has started reading something its `qjs_walk.go` does not: make that walk read it. `test` leaves out `pack_test.go` and `TestGeneratedTablesAreWellFormed`, which read go-intl's `data.pack` and `data/`. `test-chromium` runs the checked-in go-intl, Intl and Temporal tests. Chromium removes individual resources as well as locales, so filtering locales out of Node's corpora cannot turn them into browser expectations. Keep the full Node checks in `test`, and use the recorded Chromium corpora for the shipped packs. `test-chromium` does not need an upstream checkout or a browser installed.
