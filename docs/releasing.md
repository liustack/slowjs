# Releasing

## Versions

- Releases are patch versions: v0.26.0, v0.26.1, and so on. A fix or a speedup, even a large one, is the next patch version. A release that removes or changes a public API is the next minor version, as v0.27.0 was for the functions it removed from `lib`. Do not move to a new minor version for anything else: that is for the owner of the repository to decide.
- `github.com/liustack/slowjs` has no GitHub releases. A release is a tag, and users get it with `go get github.com/liustack/slowjs@<version>`.
- v0.28.0 renamed the module from `github.com/liustack/quickjs`. The `go.mod` of every tag up to v0.27.x names the old path, so those versions stay available only at the old path, and the Go module proxy keeps serving them there.

## Before the release

On the branch, before it is merged:

1. The checks of [testing.md](testing.md#before-committing) pass, and those for what the branch touches (the focused checks, test262, `make build_all_targets`). `make check-full` passes, on a machine with LLVM 22.1.8: the checked-in engine is what the generator makes, and the root package, the race detector, the sanitizers and test262 pass.
2. Each change is in the doc of its area under [changes](changes/README.md), with its row in the index, and a change for speed is in [performance.md](performance.md).
3. [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) and [CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md](../CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md) say what the branch changes for users. The last commit of the branch puts it under the new version and the date (`docs(changelog): release v0.26.17`), so that the merge commit you tag carries it.

Then merge it into `main` with a merge commit, `merge: <what the branch does>` (see [commit.md](commit.md#branches-and-merges)).

## Tagging

Ask the owner before you create a tag and again before you push one. A pushed tag is public at once and the Go module proxy keeps it for good: it cannot be taken back, only replaced by the next version.

1. Tag the merge commit of `main` with a lightweight tag, as every release so far:

   ```sh
   git log --first-parent --oneline -3 main    # the merge commit to tag
   git tag v0.26.17 <merge commit>
   git cat-file -t v0.26.17                    # commit, not tag
   ```

2. Push `main` and the tag:

   ```sh
   git push origin main
   git push origin v0.26.17
   ```

3. Check that the proxy has it: `GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org go list -m github.com/liustack/slowjs@v0.26.17`.

## After the release

### Compare with the other engines again

A minor release runs the comparison with the other pure Go JavaScript engines again ([benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md)). Patch releases skip it unless the owner asks: while the engine changes from week to week, a new table each patch costs hours of a machine and says little. It lives in `compare/engines`, a module of its own, and runs on a Linux machine with a CPU and its hyperthread sibling kept free for it (CPU 1 and CPU 5 below):

1. Point the comparison at the release, and update the other engines if their newest versions should be in the run:

   ```sh
   cd compare/engines
   go get <module>@latest && go mod tidy      # optional, for each other engine
   ```

   `compare/engines` reaches this module through a `replace` of the repository root, so the run measures the checkout it is in: check out the tag first.

2. Run every workload, five rounds, and the tifa pages with the reference rows:

   ```sh
   run="<date>-<version>-<host>"
   go run ./cmd/compare -cpu 1 -sibling 5 -name "$run"
   tifa/polyfill/build.sh && native/build.sh "$HOME/jsnative"
   page_dir=$(mktemp -d "/tmp/$run-pages.XXXXXX")
   tifa/run.sh "$page_dir" bin "$HOME/jsnative"    # TIFA_ONLY=a,b runs only some engines
   go run ./cmd/behind "results/$run.json"
   ```

   With `-cpu 1 -sibling 5` the driver pins timed processes to CPU 1 with GOMAXPROCS=1. `tifa/run.sh` pins both functional checks (normal, stub and proxy) and timed processes to CPU 1, with GOMAXPROCS=1 and TZ=UTC. Both stages use the same 4 GiB capped entry and allow at most three tries for CPU disturbance. The binaries are built with `-pgo=off`. On a shared machine, cut the run into pieces with `-add` and run test262 on another CPU at low priority, as [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md#rerun) shows. When an engine fails shop pages and closes its runtime, measure the other pages in a run of their own, as the same section says.

3. After any rest runs or single-page probes, write and commit both page files with one command:

   ```sh
   go run ./cmd/pages "$page_dir" --output "results/$run-pages" &&
     git add "results/$run-pages.md" "results/$run-pages.json" &&
     git commit -m "docs(bench): record $run pages" -m "Archive page times and normalized HTML digests so equality can be checked from the saved results."
   ```

   The JSON keeps raw process results, rest runs, probes, tries and per-page HTML comparisons. Commit `results/<run>.json` and `results/<run>.md` too, update the tables of [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md) and the list of where the engine is far behind, and add the run to its History.
4. If the method changed (a workload, an engine, a pinned input, a setting), add an entry to `compare/engines/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Upgrade tifa

slowjs exists for tifa, so every release goes into tifa next:

1. In tifa, `go get github.com/liustack/slowjs@v0.26.17` and `go mod tidy`.
2. Collect tifa's engine profile again, as tifa's [docs/testing.md](https://github.com/liustack/tifa/blob/main/docs/testing.md#the-engine-profile) says under "The engine profile": PGO finds call sites by line, so a profile of the old engine matches fewer of them. `TestEngineProfileMatchesTheDependencies` in tifa's `internal/codegen` fails until it is collected again.
3. Put the numbers each change was measured with before it merged into tifa's docs/performance.md and its changelogs. Do not measure the release again as a whole: each change was already measured against main. Measure on tifa's pages ([Measuring in tifa](performance.md#measuring-in-tifa)) only when the owner asks, or when two changes of the release may affect each other.
4. Run tifa's checks. The SSR soak tests (`TIFA_SSR_SOAK=1`) also cover running out of memory and VM reuse.
