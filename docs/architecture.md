# Architecture

`github.com/liustack/slowjs` is a pure Go, cgo-free embeddable JavaScript engine (ES2023), named `github.com/liustack/quickjs` until v0.27.x. It is a fork of two modernc.org modules, merged into one Go module:

| Upstream module | Upstream repository | Here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modernc.org/quickjs` (the Go API) | https://gitlab.com/cznic/quickjs | repository root, package `github.com/liustack/slowjs` (package name `slowjs`) |
| `modernc.org/libquickjs` (QuickJS transpiled to Go by ccgo) | https://gitlab.com/cznic/libquickjs | `lib/`, package `github.com/liustack/slowjs/lib` |

The fork starts from quickjs v0.25.0 and libquickjs v0.13.1 (QuickJS release 2026-06-04, commit `3d5e064`). The engine lives in the same module as the Go API so that a fix to it ships together with the Go API, without waiting for an upstream release of either module. [fork-changes](fork-changes/README.md) lists what the fork changed.

There is no C compiler, no cgo and no shared library: the whole engine cross-compiles as ordinary Go. `grep -rn 'import "C"'` finds nothing. Do not bring cgo in.

## The three layers

1. **`lib/`**: QuickJS as ccgo transpiled it, in `lib/ccgo_<goos>_<goarch>.go` (one file per target, `ccgo_windows.go` for windows/amd64), plus the fork's hand-written Go next to it. Symbol conventions to know when editing the wrapper: `lib.X*` are exported C functions (`XJS_NewRuntime`, `XJS_Eval`), `lib.T*` C types (`TJSValue`, `TJSRuntime`, `TJSContext`, `TJSAtom`), `lib.E*` enum constants (`EJS_TAG_NULL`), `lib.M*` macro constants (`MJS_EVAL_TYPE_GLOBAL`, `MCONFIG_VERSION`). Every transpiled C function takes a `*libc.TLS` as its first argument.
2. **`modernc.org/libc`** (external): the C runtime in Go. `libc.TLS` is the emulated thread-local storage and C stack, where the engine keeps C locals whose address is taken (its "TLS frames"). Memory the engine touches is allocated with `libc.Xcalloc`, `libc.Xmalloc` and `libc.Xfree`, and strings with `libc.CString`, not on Go's heap.
3. **The Go API** (`quickjs.go` and the files next to it): what users import.

## Folders

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `quickjs.go`, `quickjs64.go`, `promise.go`, `builtin.go`, `etc.go` | The Go API |
| `tlsstack_linux.go`, `tlsstack_other.go` | How the VM puts libc's TLS stack back after a panic, and the 1 MiB block kept outside linux |
| `lib/ccgo_*.go` | The generated engine. Never edited by hand: `internal/fixlib` rewrites them |
| `lib/*.go` (the rest) | Hand-written Go the generated engine calls: `backtrace.go` (lazy error stacks), `uncatchable.go`, `outofmemory.go`, `objlit.go`, `regexskip.go`, `poll.go`, `runtime.go` (the fork's state at the end of `JSRuntime`), `frontcache.go`, `shareddebug.go` (source text and line tables read in place), `shapecache.go`, `forin.go`, `bitwise.go`, `eq.go`, `atomkey.go`, `jsonstr.go`, `stringsearch.go` (string searches), `funcshape.go`, `regexcache.go`, `clock.go` (the engine's clocks), `expect.go` (likely and unlikely tests), `fastframes_linux.go` (TLS frames without a call on linux), `test262_runner.go` |
| `lib/goasm_*` | The interpreter in Go assembly that linux/amd64 runs by default, made by `internal/goasm`, and the Go side that calls it. `-tags slowjs_nogoasm` builds the generated Go interpreter there too (see [go-assembly.md](fork-changes/go-assembly.md)) |
| `engine/` | The C tree of the new engine: QuickJS at the pinned commit with the fork's C changes. No Go file, and no Go package may hold a C file. `internal/goasm` reads it. Until the switch it is the same text as the pinned archive with `quickjs.diff` and `cpatch.py` applied (see [testing.md](testing.md#the-goasm-interpreter)) |
| `internal/goasm/` | The maintainer tool that compiles the C interpreter of `engine/` to Go assembly (see its README) |
| `lib/internal/patch/quickjs.diff` | The fork's changes in C, for a regeneration of `lib/` (see [upgrading.md](upgrading.md#the-c-patch)) |
| `lib/internal/patch/test262.diff` | Upstream's patch to test262 |
| `lib/internal/run-test262/` | The test262 runner, a module of its own (see [testing.md](testing.md#test262)) |
| `lib/README.md`, `lib/CLAUDE.md`, `lib/Makefile`, `lib/generator.go`, `lib/builder.json` | Upstream libquickjs files, kept as they are so that a `git subtree pull` merges cleanly. `lib/generator.go` still assumes it is the root of its own module, and this fork does not regenerate `lib/` with it |
| `internal/fixlib/` | The command that puts the fork's changes into the generated Go (see [upgrading.md](upgrading.md)) |
| `intl/` | Package `github.com/liustack/slowjs/intl`, `Intl` for a VM |
| `internal/gointl/internal/qjspack/gen/` | The shared Intl data packs, selected with Chromium's ICU inventory |
| `intl/testdata/chromium/` | What Chromium answers, for the golden test, and `record.cjs`, which records it |
| `temporal/` | Package `github.com/liustack/slowjs/temporal`, `Temporal` for a VM |
| `temporal/testdata/` | The expressions compared with Chromium and its answers, and the program the link test builds |
| `internal/gointl/` | A copy of go-intl (pure Go ECMA-402 and Temporal), behind every `intl` constructor and behind `temporal` (see [upgrading.md](upgrading.md#updating-go-intl-internalgointl)) |
| `internal/intlhook/` | What package `temporal` takes from package `intl`: the formatting of its `toLocaleString` and a VM's default zone |
| `fmt/` | Package `github.com/liustack/slowjs/fmt` |
| `compare/` | A module of its own, kept from upstream, that runs QuickJS's micro benchmarks on this engine, goja and fastschema/qjs |
| `internal/arewefastyet/` | The V8 benchmark suite (v8-v7) that `TestMemgrind` in `memgrind_test.go` runs |
| `internal/autogen/`, `builder.json`, `generator.go`, `testdata/benchmarks/` | Upstream's builder fleet and benchmark table (see below) |
| `scripts/docs-list.sh` | The index of `docs/` |

## Core types

- `runtime` (unexported): wraps `lib.TJSRuntime` and its own `*libc.TLS`. One TLS per runtime.
- `VM`, the main handle: wraps a `lib.TJSContext` (a JS realm). Made by `NewVM()`, released by `Close()`. Not safe for concurrent use by several goroutines, and neither is `runtime`.
- `Value`: wraps a reference-counted `lib.TJSValue`. `Dup()` and `Free()` must be strictly paired and properly nested (the type's doc says how this breaks across goroutines and channels). Getting it wrong causes leaks or use after free, which the memgrind tests catch.
- `Object`, `Atom` (`lib.TJSAtom`) and `HostFunc` (`func(args []any) (any, error)`).
- `Builtin`, a Go function javascript calls as a built-in, and `Args`, the arguments of its call (see [Go functions called from javascript](#go-functions-called-from-javascript)).

## Values

`JSValue` is NaN-boxed. Every supported target is 64-bit and little-endian, so `TJSValue` is a struct with an `.Ftag` field, and `quickjs64.go` defines the helpers that read and build it: `sizeofJsValue`, `null`, `undefined`, `newFloat`, `newBool`, `tag`, `isException`, `jsvToInt32`, `jsvSetInt32`, `jsvToFloat64`, `jsvToPtr`.

ccgo represents `JSValueUnion` as its widest member, a `uint64`, and reads the narrow members as values (`JS_MKVAL` zero-extends into the low 32 bits, `JS_VALUE_GET_INT` truncates). So the `int32` or bool payload lives in the low 32 bits of the union. Read and write it through `jsvToInt32` and `jsvSetInt32`, not through the address of the union. The float64 and pointer payloads are as wide as the union, so those stay plain casts.

## Go functions called from javascript

`fp(f)` takes the raw code pointer out of a Go func value (the second word of the interface) so that it can be handed to C as a function pointer: the interrupt handler, host functions and module loaders use it. Go functions given to javascript with `RegisterFunc` or `RegisterHostFunc` are kept alive in registries for the whole process, keyed by an int32 "magic": `goFuncs` (and `freeMagic` for reuse) under `goFuncsMu`, with magics handed out by the atomic counter `staticMagic`. Module loaders live in `customLoaders` under `customLoadersMu`. These are global to the process, not per VM.

A `Builtin` (`builtin.go`) is the fast path: made once per process by `NewBuiltin`, kept in the copy-on-write `builtins.list` indexed by its magic, and turned into a function object per VM by `VM.NewBuiltinFunction`. `callBuiltin` finds its VM from the context's opaque, the VM's id in `vms`, a table read without a lock. It keeps the `host` count, the TLS mark and the panic and uncatchable handling of `callGo`: change one, change the other. `VM.NewArray` builds an array with `JS_DefinePropertyValueUint32`, so no setter on `Array.prototype` runs: a Builtin returns a list with it.

## The eval timeout and Interrupt

Each `VM` has an `interruptData` struct, allocated in libc memory, that holds `interrupt int32` and `timeLimit int64`. Every method that runs javascript (`Eval`, `EvalValue`, `Call`, `CallValue`, `ExecutePendingJobs` and the others) calls `m.enter()` and `defer m.leave()` before it runs javascript. `enter` counts how deep the calls go, and only the outermost call runs `configureInterrupt()`, which sets the deadline again from `m.timeout` and clears the interrupt flag. So a Go function that evaluates more javascript on the same VM stays inside the outer call's time and keeps a pending `Interrupt()`. The C side, `interruptHandler`, reads both fields. The deadline is on the monotonic clock (see [uncatchable.md](fork-changes/uncatchable.md#the-eval-timeout-runs-on-the-monotonic-clock)).

`SetEvalTimeout` sets the duration. `Interrupt()` sets the flag atomically, from any goroutine. It reaches the flag through `VM.intr`, a struct on Go's heap whose mutex orders it with `Close`, which frees the flag. `Close` clears only the embedded `vmState`, never `intr`, so `Interrupt` is safe from any goroutine during and after `Close`. Keep new VM fields in `vmState`. When you add a method that runs javascript, add the `enter` and `leave` pair, or the timeout will not apply to it.

## Packages next to the engine

- **`intl/`**: All `Intl` constructors on `internal/gointl`, and the `toLocale*` methods and `localeCompare`, for a VM that calls `Register(vm)`. QuickJS has no `Intl`: neither Bellard's engine nor quickjs-ng implements ECMA-402, so it is not a build option, and a page that reaches for `Intl` without `Register` gets a `ReferenceError`. The locales are those Chromium has, from CLDR 48.2, and the output is compared with Chromium (see [time-and-intl.md](fork-changes/time-and-intl.md#intl-in-every-locale-chromium-has)). The javascript side is `intl.js` and `stub.js` (embedded with `go:embed`), and every formatting decision is made in Go. `intl.js` is a function of the `Builtin`s in `bridge.go`, which the install in `stub.js` calls it with, so none of them is ever on `globalThis`. A constructor resolves its locales and options into an id in the process-wide `registry.go` (bounded, shared by all VMs). Every later call passes the id, and a Builtin answers `undefined` for an id the registry dropped, on which `intl.js` resolves the same arguments again. Values cross as strings, numbers and booleans, lists as arrays (`VM.NewArray`), and `resolvedOptions()` as JSON. `stub.js` takes the built-ins both scripts use at `Register` time, before any page code runs, and `intl.js` uses only those, null-prototype descriptors and arrays, and a private field for internal slots (`intl/testdata/chromium/tamper.js` lists what a page may change). The comment at the top of `bridge.go` says how to add a constructor. `intl/memgrind_test.go`, which `make leak` runs, checks the handling of `Value`s. `intl/golden_test.go` is the check that matters after touching a formatter: the spec says what the options mean, but only the data knows details such as when a minute grows a leading zero.
- **`temporal/`**: `Temporal`, for a VM that calls `Register(vm)`, built as `intl/` is: stand-ins in `stub.js`, then on first use `temporal.js`, a function of one `Builtin` in `bridge.go` whose first argument names the operation (the `opNames` list). go-intl's temporal package does every computation. An object keeps its internal slots as numbers and strings in a private field, out of every page's reach, and passes them to the Builtin, which rebuilds the go-intl value for the call and answers with an array of numbers (the groups are in the comment at the top of `values.go`), or with an error's name and message for `temporal.js` to throw. `toLocaleString` goes to package `intl` through `internal/intlhook`, which `intl` fills when it is initialized, so `intl` does not import `temporal`. Both shims receive a private object rooted in a private field of the global object. It shares Temporal slot and Intl locale readers without exposing them to page code. Each VM's clock is kept in a table keyed by the VM, which `VM.OnClose` empties. `link_test.go` checks which of go-intl's packs a program with Temporal links: `tz.bin` and those of `intl`, the date and zone-name packs for formatting, and no host-zone guessing pack (see [temporal.md](fork-changes/temporal.md)).
- **`internal/gointl/`**: a copy of go-intl (pure Go ECMA-402 and Temporal) at the commit in `internal/gointl/UPSTREAM`, which `intl` uses for every constructor, including Date and Temporal formatting and date ranges, and `temporal` for all of Temporal. Only the `qjs*` files and `UPSTREAM` are ours. Edit go-intl's files only through `qjs.patch` and `qjs-sync.sh` (see [Updating go-intl](upgrading.md#updating-go-intl-internalgointl)). Its data is the packs in `qjsdata/`, written by `internal/qjspack/gen`, not go-intl's `data.pack`. `make gointl` runs the checks that need build tags, and checks that the packs are current.
- **`fmt/`**: package `github.com/liustack/slowjs/fmt`, part of this module (it has no `go.mod` of its own). It gives a VM Go's `fmt.Printf`, `Println`, `Sprintf` and `Sprintln` with `Register(obj Value)`, with lower-case names in javascript (`fmt.println`).
- **`compare/`**: a module of its own (`github.com/liustack/slowjs/compare`) that runs the micro benchmarks of QuickJS in `compare/testdata/` on this engine, on `github.com/dop251/goja` and on `github.com/fastschema/qjs`, leaving out the 6 that goja or qjs fails. `make benchmark` runs there. It is a module of its own so that its dependencies (goja, qjs, wazero, regexp2 and so on) stay out of the library's `go.mod`, where every user would see them. `compare/go.mod` has `replace github.com/liustack/slowjs => ../`, so the benchmarks always build the work tree and `go mod tidy` takes the versions of `libc` and the rest from the root `go.mod`: never copy those versions by hand. Its indirect requirements are only lower bounds, and a newer version in the root `go.mod` stops the benchmarks with `updates to go.mod needed`, so the `benchmark` target runs `go mod tidy` first. The `github.com/liustack/slowjs` require line is not resolved (the replace wins) and nothing reads it.
- **`internal/autogen/*.mod`**: 5 copies of `go.mod`, one per `GOOS_GOARCH`, kept by the "autogen" feature of upstream's modernc.org builder fleet (see `builder.json`). The "<arch> auto generate" commits before the fork are these. Do not edit them by hand.
- **`testdata/benchmarks/<os>_<arch>.txt`**: recorded benchmark output, one file per platform. The first line, `# root go.mod sha256 <hex>`, says what it was measured against.
- **`generator.go`** (`//go:build ignore`, run by `//go:generate go run generator.go`): runs `make benchmark` for the host platform and writes the `# Performance` table in the package doc of `quickjs.go` from the geomean rows of every `testdata/benchmarks/*.txt`. A table edited by hand is overwritten. It benchmarks only when the file of the host platform is missing or was measured against another root `go.mod`, then writes the table again either way. So a local `go generate` after a dependency upgrade runs the whole benchmark suite. The `CCGO:` label is the engine in `lib/`, and the `GOJA:` and `QJS:` labels come from `compare/go.mod`. This table compares engines on micro benchmarks only: [performance.md](performance.md) has render speed in tifa.

## Platforms

5 targets (see the package doc of `quickjs.go` and `builder.json`): darwin/{amd64,arm64}, linux/{amd64,arm64} and windows/amd64. Other targets are not supported: the module has no generated engine for them, so a build for one stops with an error that names the supported targets (`lib/0unsupported.go`). On linux/amd64 the interpreter is the one in Go assembly unless the build has `-tags slowjs_nogoasm`, and the other four always run the generated Go interpreter. A change must keep `make build_all_targets` passing on all five (see [testing.md](testing.md#every-target)).
