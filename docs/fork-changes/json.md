# JSON

## JSON copies runs of plain characters

Release: v0.26.17.

`JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` copy the plain characters of a string in runs. Both went through a string one character at a time: `JSON.stringify` read each with `string_getc` and wrote it with `string_buffer_putc`, and `JSON.parse` put each byte of its text into the new string the same way, decoding UTF-8 with `unicode_from_utf8`. Now, at the start of each turn of those loops, `jsonQuoteRun` and `jsonStringRun` (`lib/jsonstr.go`) copy the run of characters the loop would put as they are, in one Go copy, and leave the loop the character that ended the run: one to escape, the end of the string, a surrogate (`JSON.stringify` decides how to write it) or a byte that is not valid UTF-8 (`JSON.parse` throws the same error at the same place).

The new string grows and becomes 16-bit as with `string_buffer_write8` and `string_buffer_write16`, so it is the same string, and running out of memory in a run fails the call as before. A run of `JSON.parse` stops at the length of the longest string, so a text of `JS_ParseJSON` with a longer string still throws "string too long". Reviver, replacer, `toJSON`, `space` and the other paths are not touched.

On linux/amd64 without PGO (AMD EPYC 7B13, one core), against 4a4103b (v0.26.16 and 9 later commits), quoting the JSON text of each route's data of tifa's example shop as one string again, as tifa does, takes 41% less time, and `JSON.parse` of its render data 9.5% less, while a document of many short strings and numbers parses in the same time and stringifies in 2% less. JSON is about 1% of a render, so a render can gain at most about 0.3%. The 8 rounds measured 0.2% to 1.7% less, inside the spread of a round. The HTML and the memory are the same.

`fixlib` puts the two calls into all 5 files and takes the length, the 16-bit flag and the offset of the characters of a `JSString` from each file's `JS_ToQuotedString` and `string_get`. Generated Go only, no C hunk (`internal/fixlib/jsonstr.go`).

Tests: `lib/jsonstr_test.go`, whose `testdata/jsonstr.txt` is what Node 24 prints for `testdata/jsonstr.js` (strings of every kind of character at the lengths around the runs, as ropes, substrings and keys, through `stringify`, `parse`, reviver, replacer and `toJSON`), the errors and their positions and the invalid UTF-8 cases against the engine before the change, both runs called directly on buffers of every room, 8-bit and 16-bit (the characters, where the run stops, and a buffer never filled past its room), each way a run grows or widens a buffer failing for lack of memory, and a run past the longest string, `lib/jsonstr_memgrind_test.go` (no C memory left behind) and `internal/fixlib/jsonstr_test.go`.

The C tree (`engine/quickjs.c`) has the same change in C: `JS_ToQuotedString` calls `json_quote_run` and `json_parse_string` calls `json_string_run` at the start of each turn of their loops. They write with `string_buffer_write8` and `string_buffer_write16`, and `json_string_run` decodes with `unicode_from_utf8`, as the loop does. `engine/test/compare.sh` runs `testdata/jsonstr.js` and `testdata/jsonstr_errors.js` on it and on the Go engine.

### When upstream changes it

What to do when `go run ./internal/fixlib` stops on this change after an upstream release. [upgrading.md](../upgrading.md) has the whole procedure and the order in which to update the lists `fixlib` checks against.

If it reports that a function of `jsonFuncs` changed (`internal/fixlib/jsonsites.go`), read them against `lib/jsonstr.go`: `JS_ToQuotedString` must still write every character that is not `"`, `\`, below 0x20 or a surrogate as it is, `json_parse_string` must still put every byte from 0x20 to 0x7f that is not the quote or `\` as it is and decode the others with `unicode_from_utf8`, which must still take the forms `jsonUTF8` takes, and `string_buffer_write8` and `string_buffer_write16` must still grow and widen the buffer as `jsonWrite8` and `jsonWrite16` do. Then run `-json`. If it reports that a loop or `string_get` changed shape, update `reQuoteLoop`, `reParseLoop` or `reJSONWide` in `internal/fixlib/jsonstr.go`, and run `go test -run JSONString ./lib`.
