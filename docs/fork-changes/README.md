  - Asking what this fork changes compared with modernc.org/quickjs and libquickjs
  - Looking for the doc of a fork change before changing it, or after fixlib stopped on it
  - Adding a new fork change, to see where it belongs

# Fork changes

The fork starts from quickjs v0.25.0 and libquickjs v0.13.1 (QuickJS release 2026-06-04, commit `3d5e064`). Each doc below takes one area. For each change it says what the change does, why it is safe, what it gains or costs and how that was measured, which tests check it, and, under "When upstream changes it", what to do when `fixlib` stops on it after an upstream release. [upgrading.md](../upgrading.md) has the procedure of an upgrade, and [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) what each release changed for users.

Changes to the generated Go are made by `internal/fixlib` (see [upgrading.md](../upgrading.md)). A change that also has a C form is in `lib/internal/patch/quickjs.diff`, so a regeneration of `lib/` keeps it. The Go changes made for speed have no C form. The native dispatch condition below changes only the C patch.

v0.26.14 also made `fixlib` stop wherever an upstream change could make it fix the code wrong: most of the checks under "When upstream changes it" come from that release.

## Adding a change

- Put it in the doc of its area, or in a new doc here when no area fits, and add a row to the table above, with "Unreleased" as its release until it ships. Never write it into README.md, which only links here.
- Say what it does, why it is safe, what it gains or costs with the machine and how it was measured, which tests check it, whether it has a C form, and what to do when `fixlib` stops on it.
- Add it to [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) and [CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md](../../CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md), and a change for speed to [performance.md](../performance.md).
