# Upstream

English · [简体中文](upstream.zh-CN.md)

## Where the code comes from

The code was built in four steps, each on the one before:

1. **[QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs)**, the JavaScript engine in C by Fabrice Bellard and Charlie Gordon. This fork's engine is the QuickJS release of 2026-06-04, commit `3d5e064e9dd67c70f7962836505a7fa067bf0a4e` (see `qjsCommit` in `lib/generator.go`).
2. **[modernc.org/libquickjs](https://gitlab.com/cznic/libquickjs)**, that C translated to Go by ccgo, with no cgo. The fork took v0.13.1 (2026-07-31) into `lib/` with `git subtree`.
3. **[modernc.org/quickjs](https://gitlab.com/cznic/quickjs)**, the Go API over libquickjs. The fork starts from v0.25.0 (2026-10-01), which is commit `ea7b851` in this repository's history.
4. **This fork**, `github.com/liustack/slowjs` (named `github.com/liustack/quickjs` until v0.27.x), which merges the Go API and the engine into one module.

modernc.org/libquickjs and modernc.org/quickjs are by the quickjs-go authors. Their `AUTHORS` files, kept as upstream has them in [AUTHORS](../AUTHORS) and [lib/AUTHORS](../lib/AUTHORS), list Jan Mercl for both and Dan Kortschak for modernc.org/quickjs. The authors of this fork are in [AUTHORS-FORK](../AUTHORS-FORK).

## What the fork keeps and what it changed

The fork keeps the Go API of modernc.org/quickjs and the engine as ccgo makes it. The generated files under `lib/` are never edited by hand: `internal/fixlib` rewrites them mechanically after every upstream release, and the committed files are exactly what `fixlib` makes from the upstream files, byte for byte ([how to check](testing.md#same-as-upstream-after-fixlib)). The test262 suite gives the same 58 known failures as upstream.

What it changed is listed one change at a time in [fork-changes](fork-changes/README.md): limits that no script can catch, the same output on every machine, `Intl` in every locale Chromium has, and faster renders. [upgrading.md](upgrading.md) says how a new release of libquickjs, of modernc.org/quickjs or of modernc.org/libc is taken in.

## Switching from modernc.org/quickjs

What a program that used modernc.org/quickjs v0.25.0 runs into:

- **Import paths.** `modernc.org/quickjs` becomes `github.com/liustack/slowjs`, and the package name `quickjs` becomes `slowjs`. Its `intl` and `fmt` packages move with it. The engine is `github.com/liustack/slowjs/lib`, so `modernc.org/libquickjs` leaves your `go.mod`.
- **Go version.** The module needs Go 1.27, where upstream needs 1.26.
- **Local time is UTC.** A script's local time is UTC in every VM, whatever `TZ` the process has. Name a zone to `Intl` to show another one ([details](fork-changes/time-and-intl.md#local-time-is-utc-in-every-vm)).
- **Intl in every locale.** Package `intl` formats in every locale Chromium has, where upstream formats en-US only. Programs that import it embed the locale data and its notices ([details](fork-changes/time-and-intl.md#intl-in-every-locale-chromium-has)).
- **Limits end the call.** An interrupt, the eval timeout and running out of memory can no longer be caught by the script, through `catch`, promises, iterators or Go functions ([details](fork-changes/uncatchable.md)).
- **Errors say more.** `*Error` has `Uncatchable`, `OutOfMemory` and `Interrupted`. A string that cannot be converted comes back as an error rather than `""`. `Error()` of an `*Error` made in Go is `Name: Message` rather than empty ([details](fork-changes/go-api.md)).
- **Strings.** A Go string from javascript is always valid UTF-8, and invalid UTF-8 from Go becomes one U+FFFD per byte ([details](fork-changes/go-api.md#valid-utf-8-for-lone-surrogates)).
- **Panics.** A panic in the engine itself, or a Go function that calls `runtime.Goexit`, leaves the VM good only for `Close` ([details](fork-changes/calls-and-tls-frames.md#frames-freed-without-defer)).
- **Endless recursion** throws a `RangeError` rather than killing the process ([details](fork-changes/errors-and-stacks.md#endless-recursion-throws-rangeerror)).
- **No std, os or Worker in `lib`.** The engine leaves out the parts of QuickJS's shell that the Go API never reached: `lib` no longer has `js_init_module_std`, `js_init_module_os`, `js_std_loop`, `js_std_init_handlers` and seven more. The bytecode of modules works as before, and a program is a few hundred KB smaller ([details](fork-changes/trimmed.md)).
- **No module loading, shell helpers or blocking.** `VM.SetModuleLoader`, `VM.SetDefaultModuleLoader` with `ModuleLoaderFunc` and `ModuleNormalizeFunc`, `VM.StdAddHelpers` (`console.log`, `print`, `performance.now`, `__loadScript`) and `VM.SetCanBlock` are gone. A module can import only a module the VM already has, such as itself by its name `<eval>`, and `Atomics.wait` always throws ([details](fork-changes/go-api.md#no-module-loader-shell-helpers-or-setcanblock)).
- **Five platforms.** The module builds for linux and darwin on amd64 and arm64, and windows on amd64. A build for any other target stops with an error that names these ([details](architecture.md#platforms)).
- **Another interpreter on linux/amd64.** There the bytecode interpreter is Go assembly compiled from the C, and `-tags slowjs_nogoasm` gives back the Go one. Scripts give the same results with either ([details](fork-changes/go-assembly.md)).
- **New API.** `NewBuiltin`, `VM.NewBuiltinFunction` and `Args`, `VM.NewArray`, `VM.SetStrip` with `type Strip`, `VM.RunGC`, `VM.RunYoungGC` ([details](fork-changes/young-collection.md)), `VM.MemorySize` and `VM.GCThreshold`, `VM.MemoryUsage` with `type MemoryUsage` and `VM.ReleaseMemory`, `VM.SetShapeCache` with `DefaultShapeCache`, `VM.OnClose`, `NewSharedBytecode` with `VM.EvalSharedBytecode`, `GetAsyncContext` and `SetAsyncContext` ([details](fork-changes/go-api.md)), `VM.SetClock` and `VM.Now` ([details](fork-changes/time-and-intl.md#one-wall-clock-per-vm)), and package `temporal` ([details](fork-changes/temporal.md)).

The [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) has every change of each release.
