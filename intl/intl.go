// Package intl implements ECMA-402, the ECMAScript Internationalization API,
// for a [slowjs.VM].
//
// QuickJS has no Intl. It is not a disabled build option: neither Bellard's
// engine nor quickjs-ng implements ECMA-402, so a page or bundle that reaches
// for Intl.DateTimeFormat gets a ReferenceError. [Register] installs a Go
// backed implementation of the parts of the API pages depend on:
//
//   - Intl.DateTimeFormat: date and time styles, the component options,
//     hour cycles, day periods, time zone names, and the IANA time zone
//     database behind the timeZone option.
//   - Intl.NumberFormat: grouping, fraction and significant digits, rounding
//     modes, percent, currency, unit, compact and scientific notation, and
//     numbering systems.
//   - Intl.PluralRules: cardinal and ordinal rules, select and selectRange.
//   - Intl.Collator, and String.prototype.localeCompare through it: the
//     collation types, sensitivity, numeric, caseFirst, ignorePunctuation
//     and search usage, from go-intl (internal/gointl), which is ICU's
//     collation in Go over the data Chromium ships.
//   - Intl.Segmenter: graphemes, words, with the dictionaries of Thai, Lao,
//     Khmer, Burmese, Chinese and Japanese, and sentences.
//   - Intl.RelativeTimeFormat: every unit and style, words such as
//     "yesterday" with numeric auto, and numbering systems.
//   - Intl.ListFormat: conjunctions, disjunctions and unit lists in every
//     style, with the joins that depend on the next item, as Spanish "e"
//     and "u" and Hebrew "ו-".
//   - Intl.DisplayNames: the names of languages, with dialect names such
//     as "British English" or without, of regions, scripts, currencies,
//     calendars and date fields, in every style.
//   - Intl.DurationFormat: every style and each unit's own, digital
//     clocks with fractional seconds, and durations given as objects or as
//     Temporal's duration strings ("PT1H30M"), as Chromium takes them.
//   - Intl.Locale: tags built from options, likely subtags added and
//     removed, every getter, and the calendars, collations, hour cycles,
//     numbering systems, time zones, text direction and week of a locale.
//     A Locale stands for its tag wherever a constructor takes locales.
//   - Intl.supportedValuesOf, which lists the calendars, collations,
//     currencies, numbering systems, time zones and units the constructors
//     take.
//   - Intl.getCanonicalLocales and each constructor's supportedLocalesOf.
//
// Register also replaces Date.prototype.toLocaleString, toLocaleDateString and
// toLocaleTimeString along with Number.prototype.toLocaleString,
// BigInt.prototype.toLocaleString and String.prototype.localeCompare, which
// ECMA-402 redefines in terms of those constructors, and
// String.prototype.toLocaleUpperCase and toLocaleLowerCase, which map case
// by the rules of Turkish and Azeri ("i" to "İ"), Lithuanian and, to upper
// case, Greek ("άδικος" to "ΑΔΙΚΟΣ"), as V8 does, and by Unicode's default
// rules in other languages. QuickJS ships fallbacks for them that ignore
// their arguments, so
//
//	new Date(0).toLocaleString("en-US", {timeZone: "America/New_York"})
//
// ignores the requested zone before Register
// and "12/31/1969, 7:00:00 PM" after it.
//
// # Locales
//
// All constructors read go-intl's data packs, selected by Chromium 156
// resource inventory, for every locale Chromium has. A locale resolves as it does in Chromium: one with no data of its own
// falls back to its parent (en-XX to en) or, failing that, to en-US. With no
// locale argument the locale is en-US and with no timeZone option the zone is
// UTC: Intl and the toLocale* methods never read the host's language or zone.
// Neither does the engine's own Date, whose local time is UTC in every VM.
//
// Dates support all 18 calendars Chromium lists. NumberFormat and PluralRules
// implement roundingIncrement and roundingPriority through go-intl.
// NumberFormat.formatRange and formatRangeToParts are not implemented.
//
// # Differences from Chromium
//
// The output is compared with Chromium 156 (V8 over ICU 78.2) on 74,868
// recorded expressions. DateTimeFormat, NumberFormat and PluralRules match
// every expression, including calendars. The other constructors have the
// known differences below. An additional 939 expressions cover the migration
// to go-intl. Three Winnipeg answers differ because the embedded tz 2026e
// keeps daylight time after October 2026, unlike Chromium's older tz data.
//
// Intl.Segmenter breaks words by ICU's rules, which Chromium changes: there a
// full stop or a colon between letters ends a word, so "U.S.A" is five
// segments and "a:b" three, and Lao and Khmer break by smaller dictionaries
// of Chromium's own, which find other words in some runs.
//
// Intl.DisplayNames names more than Chromium, whose ICU data leaves names
// out: of some languages ("tlh" for Klingon), of variants ("German (1996)"),
// of numeric regions but 419, and of currencies no longer in use, which it
// writes as their codes, or leaves undefined with fallback none. It has no
// names at all for ak, az, bs, kk, kok, pa, sd and uz, which it names as
// root does, by codes, or in English. And it has names of its own for Hong
// Kong, Macao, Palestine and the Falkland Islands ("Hong Kong" for "Hong
// Kong SAR China"). Here the names are CLDR's. The narrow names of de-CH's
// era and th's time zone are go-intl's, which ICU writes otherwise.
//
// Intl.Locale's getTimeZones for the world, 001, leaves out five zones that
// Chromium lists, EST5EDT, CST6CDT, MST7MDT, PST8PDT and Factory. Its
// baseName of a tag with -u-va-posix leaves the extension out, which V8
// keeps ("en-US-u-va-posix"). An unknown region in -u-rg-, as in
// "en-u-rg-xxzzzz", leaves the locale's own region in place for the hour
// cycle and the week, where Chromium takes the world's.
//
// Intl.supportedValuesOf("currency") lists go-intl's 162 currencies,
// including SLE, XCG and ZWG beyond Chromium's 159.
//
// Intl.DurationFormat writes a fraction of more than 2**63 nanoseconds, as
// in {nanoseconds: 1e20} with numeric seconds, as V8 does on x86-64:
// "9223372036.854775808" seconds. V8 on arm64 writes
// "9223372036.854775807".
//
// Error messages are worded differently, though the errors thrown are the
// same.
//
// Where Chromium's ICU data departs from CLDR 48.2, the data here follows
// Chromium. A language Chromium ships no dates or numbers for formats them
// with CLDR root's data, as az and kk do ("2026 M01 5, Mon"), and one it ships
// no currency, zone, unit or region names for takes them from English. Digits
// a locale does not use by default, such as arab in de, take the symbols and
// patterns Chromium has for them, which cldr-json leaves out. A
// zone's city is the one its id spells ("Sao Paulo"), Hong Kong
// and Macao go by their short names, and the zones of the British Isles are
// never "Greenwich Mean Time". fr-CH groups digits with a narrow no-break
// space (CLDR 48.1's), ko calls the North American zones 북미 (North
// America), and uk and ru write the hryvnia as грн and грн. As in Chromium,
// narrow and thin spaces in dates are written as plain spaces.
//
// # Cost
//
// The six embedded packs total 9.35 MB. Their shared tables stay in the
// binary's read-only data. Other chunks inflate into the Go heap on first
// use, once per process. Date and Temporal formatting use the same packs.
// The build tags slowjs_intl_nonames and slowjs_intl_nocjdict omit display
// names and the Chinese and Japanese word dictionary respectively.
//
// Register installs stand-ins. The first use installs the javascript half
// from bytecode compiled once per process. Resolved formatters are shared
// across VMs in a bounded registry of 1024 entries. Eviction makes an object
// resolve its saved arguments again on its next call, without changing its
// result. Date keys include the actual pattern because distinct patterns
// can report identical public resolved options.
//
// See docs/changes/time-and-intl.md for measured binary size, VM memory
// and constructor and formatting times.
//
// # License of the data
//
// The embedded locale data comes from Unicode CLDR and from the ICU data
// Chromium ships, which are under the Unicode License V3, with changes
// Chromium made to it under Chromium's BSD license. A program that imports
// this package distributes that data, and has to include the notices in
// LICENSE-DATA, in this package's directory, in its documentation or with
// its copies. It also links internal/gointl and internal/gointl/temporal,
// and has to include their notices too: internal/gointl/LICENSE and the
// NOTICE-ICU, NOTICE-ICU4X, NOTICE-TEMPORAL and NOTICE-V8 files in
// internal/gointl/qjsdata, as NOTICE.md at the module root says.
//
// # Time zones
//
// Names, offsets and daylight flags use go-intl's embedded ICU tz 2026e
// pack, shared with Temporal. No host zoneinfo or time/tzdata is read.
//
// The default zone, which is also what
// Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone reports, is UTC unless
// [TimeZone] sets another. Intl never consults the host's zone (see Locales
// for the engine's Date, which does).
