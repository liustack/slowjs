// The async context of a VM is an object javascript sets with
// SetAsyncContext and reads with GetAsyncContext, which promise jobs keep: a
// reaction, what then, catch, finally and await register, runs with the
// context the VM had when it was registered, and the VM gets back the
// context it had when the reaction ends. That is what an AsyncLocalStorage
// needs to follow an async function across await, and what V8 keeps for
// Node as the continuation preserved embedder data. A VM starts with no
// context, and promises then cost what they did before it.
//
// The context is an object or none. An AsyncLocalStorage keeps the stores of
// each of its instances in the object, as a Map from the instance to its
// store, and makes a new object for each run, so the object of a context is
// not changed once it is set.
