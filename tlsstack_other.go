// Outside linux, libc keeps the TLS stack in segments of about 4 KiB,
// each malloc'd under the one lock of libc's allocator, and frees a
// segment once the stack is two segments below it. A javascript call
// takes about 1.3 KiB of TLS frames, so a render that goes a few calls up
// and down past the end of a segment mallocs and frees segments again and
// again, and VMs on other goroutines wait for the lock.
//
// warmTLS allocates and frees one block of tlsWarm bytes right after
// NewTLS. libc keeps the block as the segment after the first, and moves
// to it whenever the first is full, so every frame up to about tlsWarm
// bytes deep goes on it and no call mallocs a segment. The block is 255
// segments, which with libc's header of a stack segment takes 256: libc's
// allocator maps it as a region of 1 MiB. Only the pages the stack reaches
// are ever written, so they are all the memory it takes, and Close frees
// it with the rest of the stack.

// internal/fixlib), so a Go panic that goes up through engine functions
// leaves their frames on the stack. The VM marks the stack where it calls
// into javascript, and where javascript calls a Go function, and puts it
// back there when the call ends, panic or not. A frame left on the stack
// would otherwise be freed by the frames below it as their own, and libc
// would then hand out memory before the start of a segment.
//
// Outside linux, libc keeps the stack as bytes in segments: TLS.Alloc and

// empties a segment goes back to the one before. The mark is the number of
