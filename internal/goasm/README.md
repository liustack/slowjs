# Offline LLVM interpreter generator

This generator ships an LLVM-generated `JS_CallInternal` as Go assembly on
linux/amd64, where programs use it by default. `-tags slowjs_nogoasm` builds
them with the ccgo interpreter instead, which other targets always use. The generator is a
maintainer tool and does not run during application builds.

The input is the C tree in `engine/`. Until the switch to the new engine, the
same text can also be made the old way (`--from-upstream`): the pinned QuickJS
archive with `lib/internal/patch/quickjs.diff` applied, then `cpatch.py`.
LLVM 22.1.8 is required. Python 3, LLVM development headers and a C++
compiler are required only to regenerate the assembly.

## Pipeline

1. The C interpreter has the fast paths that `internal/fixlib` adds only to
   the Go interpreter. They are written in `engine/quickjs.c`, and the old way
   makes them with `cpatch.py`: property reads that walk the prototype
   chain past exotic objects (fixFieldChain), the usual `===` and `==` pairs
   (fixEq), and bitwise operators on two numbers (fixBitwise). It also takes
   the string or symbol of an atom in C. Each replacement must match the
   expected number of times.
2. Preprocess the patched C and ask Clang for its typed AST. `prepare.py`
   retains the interpreter and selected inline helpers. Every remaining
   call becomes an explicitly typed external function with the SysV ABI. A
   call of the interpreter to itself takes the next TLS slot in C and enters
   the new frame through `goasm_reenter`, with no Go code in between. A call
   to a native function takes the slot and calls the function directly. The
   stack depth check reads the TLS slot index in C.
3. Optimize at `-O2`, with a frame pointer, no red zone and signed wrapping.
   `allocas.cpp` moves all addressable locals to the caller's TLS slot, at
   a fixed offset from the slot start so they need no register of their
   own, and turns the computed goto table into offsets from itself. A dynamic alloca
   of up to 768 bytes follows the locals in the slot. A larger one calls
   `goasmAllocate`, which mallocs it.
4. `lower.py` checks the compiler frame shape, converts its local addresses
   to fixed offsets in a Go frame and rejects escaping Go stack addresses.
   R14 is an ordinary C register: Go's ABI0 leaves R14 undefined, and Go
   reloads g from thread local storage around ABI0 calls and in signal
   handlers. Dispatch must jump through a register.
5. Assemble the transformed GNU syntax offline. `elf2go.py` emits machine
   bytes as Go assembler directives, with real symbolic Go CALL instructions
   for every external relocation. It rejects other relocations. Go supplies
   the stack growth prologue, frame pointer and return sequence.
6. `bridges.py` emits, for each external call, a stub that saves the SysV
   callee-saved registers (R14 included), moves the arguments to an ABI0
   frame and calls Go. When the target is a function of `lib` with matching
   argument sizes, the stub calls it directly with the TLS in place of the
   environment. Other targets get a typed Go wrapper. Indirect calls use
   ccgo's function value representation. The external engine memory
   contains no movable Go stack addresses.
7. `helpers.py` writes `lib/goasm_helpers.txt`, the C helpers `prepare.py`
   compiled into the interpreter. `TestGoasmCoversHelperRules` of
   `internal/fixlib` reads it.

`checks.py` holds the stack rules Go's movable stack needs. Each step runs
the checks for what it can break, and generation stops on a violation. See
the Stack rules section of `docs/fork-changes/go-assembly.md`.

`regenerate.py` runs the whole pipeline from the repository: it builds
`allocas.cpp` as an LLVM pass plugin, collects the Go signatures and runs
`build.py` on `engine/`. With `--from-upstream` it first unpacks the pinned
QuickJS archive and applies the patch, and `build.py` applies `cpatch.py`.

```sh
python3 internal/goasm/regenerate.py --llvm /usr/lib/llvm-22/bin           # write lib/goasm_*
python3 internal/goasm/regenerate.py --llvm /usr/lib/llvm-22/bin --check   # fail on drift
python3 internal/goasm/regenerate.py --check-engine                        # engine/ is what the old way makes (no LLVM)
```

Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s internal/goasm` for generator checks.
The engine selection is inserted by `internal/fixlib`, checks the complete
original interpreter fingerprint and verifies an exact inverse.

## Review boundaries

The generator deliberately supports one interpreter and compiler version.
New C types, indirect signatures, prologues, stack operations, relocations or
TLS local sizes require review. Changing the compiler requires regeneration,
inspection of the final linked instructions, engine tests, test262, HTML
comparison and page timing again. A successful offline build is not evidence
that arbitrary C functions can use this path safely.

The generated interpreter is the default on linux/amd64, and
`-tags slowjs_nogoasm` builds without it. Darwin/arm64 has no implementation.

After linking a linux/amd64 binary built without `slowjs_nogoasm`, check that every local byte and jump table
survived Go assembly and linking:

```sh
python3 internal/goasm/verify_linked.py output/lowered.o application
```

This permits only the four relocated displacement bytes of each symbolic CALL.
It checks the body alignment and rejects any other byte change. It also checks
that goasmRun and `__js_poll_interrupts` keep their stack check prologue. Run it on each
code layout used for timing.
